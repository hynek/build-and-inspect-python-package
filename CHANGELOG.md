## [1.2](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/compare/v1.1...v1.2)

### Added

- The location of the built packages is now returned using the `dist` output.
  [#9](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/pull/9)


## [1.1](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/compare/v1.0...v1.1)

### Changed

- Built packages are written to `/tmp` instead of into the source `dist/` directory. That means that this action leaves your directory clean.
  [#7](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/pull/7)


## [1.0](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/compare/v0.1...v1.0)

### Changed

- *twine* now runs in `--strict` mode.
- All tools are now pinned reliability (and hopefully caching in the future).
- The action now uses `setup-python` itself to enable pinning (and hopefully caching in the future). Currently, Python 3.10 is used.
- The tools are installed into a virtual environment. That means you can re-use the global Python environment and do further checks.


## [0.1](https://github.com/hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package/tree/v0.1) - 2022-08-20

### Added

- Initial Release
