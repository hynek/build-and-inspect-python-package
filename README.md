# build-and-inspect-python-package

This action provides the following functionality for GitHub Actions users that are maintaining Python packages:

1. Build your package using PyPA's [*build*](https://pypi.org/project/build/) (this works with any [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)-compatible build backend, including *Hatch*, *Flit*, *Setuptools*, *PDM*, or *Poetry*),
1. upload the *wheel* and the source distribution (*SDist*) as artifacts so you can download and inspect them from the Summary view of a Actions run,
1. lint the wheel using [*check-wheel-contents*](https://pypi.org/project/check-wheel-contents/),
1. lint the PyPI README of both *wheel* and *SDist* using [*twine*](https://pypi.org/project/twine/),
1. print you the tree of both *SDist* and *wheel* in the CI output so you don't have to download the packages just to check the contents.

This way you can make package verification part of your CI.
If you package an **application** as a Python package, this action is useful to double-check you're shipping everything you need, including all templates, translation files, et cetera.

> **Note**
> This action does **not** upload your package to PyPI.


## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  check-package:
    name: Build & inspect our package.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: hynek/build-and-inspect-python-package@v1
```

The action will run [*setup-python*](https://github.com/actions/setup-python) with Python **3.10** on its own.


### Optional Inputs

- `path`: the location of the Python package to build (default: `.`).
